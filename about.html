        <p>I began my coding journey in high school where I took a few coding classes and practice with some online teaching tools. I continued my journey in college with specialization in Information Systems Management. I always enjoyed coding, but I never pursued it with full focus. After graduating in August 2020 and trying out the job market, I decided that a career in Web/Stack Development was of great interest to me. This led me to Lambda, where I am now pursuing further comprehension in Web Development.</p>
